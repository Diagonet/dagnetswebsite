      <h1>Dagnet Point's Scoreboard</h1>
      <p>
        Here you can check your ranking based on you DagPoints速 in real time!

      <h2>What are DagPoints速 anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Glad you asked! DagPoints速 are the official way to rewards (and punish)
        people according to Dagnet's own values.
      </p>
      <h2>Why should I care about my DagPoints速 score?</h2>
      <p>You shouldn't.</p>
      <h2>My ranking is currently low, how do I change that?</h2>
      <p>You have two main options:
        <ul>
          <li>Increase your score by doing things Dagnet likes</li>
          <li>Sabotage the people who have better scores than you</li>
        </ul>
        I think we all know which is the correct choice here.
