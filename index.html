        <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
        <p>
          I know what you are thinking, "is this dagnet guy so full of himself
          that he thought the world needed a website just for him?" or maybe
          "Oh, I should buy a hamburger". I can utmostly assure you that is
          <i>NOT</i> the case <i>yet</i>. To prove so I will no list my reasons
          to make this website
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First and foremost I wanted to practice my web developer skills
          </li>
          <li>
            As a joke I prefer to refer to my website over answering "How are
            you dagnet?" like a normal human being
          </li>
          <li>Having your own website is cool <sup>af</sup></li>
