        <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
        <p>I know what you are thinking, "is this dagnet guy so full of himself that he thought the world needed a
            website just for him?" or maybe "Oh, I should buy a hamburger".
            I can utmostly assure you that is <i>NOT</i> the case <i>yet</i>. To prove so I will no list my reasons to
            make this website</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First and foremost I wanted to practice my web developer skills</li>
            <li>As a joke I prefer to refer to my website over answering "How are you dagnet?" like a normal human being
            </li>
            <li>Having your own website is cool <sup>af</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <button id = 'greetingButton' onclick = 'randomGreeting()'>Click here to get a random greeting</button>
