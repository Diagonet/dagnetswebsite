      <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
      <p>
        I know what you are thinking, "is this dagnet guy so full of himself
        that he thought the world needed a website just for him?" or maybe "Oh,
        I should buy a hamburger". I can utmostly assure you that is
        <i>NOT</i> the case <i>yet</i>. To prove so I will no list my reasons to
        make this website
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First and foremost I wanted to practice my web developer skills</li>
        <li>
          As a joke I prefer to refer to my website over answering "How are you
          dagnet?" like a normal human being
        </li>
        <li>Having your own website is cool <sup>af</sup></li>
      </ul>
